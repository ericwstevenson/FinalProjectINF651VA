Eric Stevenson's Final Project for INF651VA

This script calculates the length of a material on a roll.
The user is prompted for three measurements:
The outside diameter of the roll, The inside diameter of the roll (core), and the thickness of the material.
Any input is accepted, but calculations throwing a non-numerical value will register as a zero.
Input is not otherwise sanitized, though future versions will include error handling to prevent negatives and non-numerical entry.
The lengths are converted into an approximation of feet and inches.
Input is taken from user with prompt after clicking button. HTML is changed using Javascript to provide results.
The user may calculate as many rolls as they wish. Logging of results may be added in future version.

Anecdotes:
This program was inspired by my own work experience. I developed this formula to estimate conveyor belt lengths.
Supervisory assumptions were often made that there was enough belt provided for a given project.
Striving for greater accuracy, I managed to greatly simplify the process of calculating belt lengths.
This formula also works for various materials (such as how much toilet paper is left on a roll).
